## ðŸš€ Quick start
**1. Clone the repo.**

`git clone https://github.com/BRdhanani/headless-wordpress-with-gatsby.git`

**2. Start developing.**

Navigate into your siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

`cd headless-wordpress-with-gatsby`
`gatsby develop`

**3. Open the source code with your favourite code editor and start editing!**

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial.

Open the gatsby-workshop directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Folder Structure
A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

**components:** This directory contains all the common components that your website depends on like header, footer etc. 

**src:** This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site .

**.gitignore:** This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

**gatsby-browser.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

**gatsby-config.js:** This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins youâ€™d like to include, base url of wordpress from which you want get data etc.

**gatsby-node.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs. These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. This file also contains all the code to fetch all the pages, posts etc.

**gatsby-ssr.js:** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

**package-lock.json** (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project.

****package.json:** A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the projectâ€™s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
